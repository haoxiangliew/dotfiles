# WSL / Windows Config
Welcome to my Windows 11 Configuration

## `winget-manager.ps1`
- A simple script to declaratively install and manage `winget` packages

## `workspacer.config.csx`
- My choice of tiling window manager for Windows
- Themed with Dracula

## `wsl-config` and `git-wsl.sh`
- My configuration for WSL2 with the ideal distro of OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
    - In my testing, NixOS-WSL does not include WSL integration tools and has some issues with interop
- `wsl-config` is `~/.config`
- `git-wsl.sh` is a script to get WSL2 to use GCM on Windows and Gpg4Win's pinentry
